  If you don't have SPRUT installed, you may need to

touch ird.c ird.h

so the build system doesn't try to regenerate them.

  Run

autoreconf -i
./configure
make

  The SHILKA
Makefile has additional entries in comparison of the top COCOM
Makefile.  These are:

test - testing SHILKA & comparing with GNU gperf (requires installed gperf)
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only SHILKA

Example of OKA specifications are files `*.shilka'.
