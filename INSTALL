  Better way to install SHILKA is usage of top COCOM configure &
Makefile (see file INSTALL in the top COCOM directory).

  In any case you need to run configure in the top COCOM directory (in
order to create Makefile for SHILKA), to build AMMUNITION and SPRUT
(because SHILKA uses them for its building).  After that we can work
with only SHILKA (building, installation, and so on).  The SHILKA
Makefile has additional entries in comparison of the top COCOM
Makefile.  These are:

test - testing SHILKA & comparing with GNU gperf (requires installed gperf)
TAGS - updating TAGS in current directory for only SHILKA

Example of OKA specifications are files `*.shilka'.
